  ## Usage:
  
The waiter or waitress goes by his tablet on customers' tables. At first, the application shows all the tables with a white background which means the table is empty. All the tables are numbered and have shown in the system accordingly. When the waiter goes to table number one, it selects the table from the app and takes the order of customers. After getting the customer's order, the background of table number one changed to amber which means the table is full and already ordered. Each order goes to its own department which means if the order is a pizza it goes to pizza making section and shows the order in thier screen in a queue by order, if the order is coffee or tea it goes to the drink section. In the end, reception can print 2 copies of bill one for the customer and another for restaurant for payment.
